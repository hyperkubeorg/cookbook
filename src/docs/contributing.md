# Contributing

This cookbook is designed explicitly for my use-cases, but I do accept contributions that I feel line up with this project's direction.

Areas that are always open to improvement include but are not limited to:
- An important production ready service most environments need.
- Troubleshooting or usage information for currently listed services.
- Correcting typos or incorrect information.

Any additional services or deployment material will be considered, but changing the stack is unlikely without solid foundational reasoning being discussed in the issue you raise.
