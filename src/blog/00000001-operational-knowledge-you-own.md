# A Work in Progress

*Published: August 24, 2025*

This site contains a distilled knowledge of how I work with Kubernetes.
Right now it is a collection of extremely rough notes.
Further information and instructions will be added as I have time to make updates.

After the operational knowledge is fleshed out, I will begin adding development knowledge for frontend/backend/fullstack development (using Typescript & Go).
